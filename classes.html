	<p> I'm only taking 13 credits this semester at Luther. I figured I would give myself a little break but I intend to take a fair amount next semester. I am taking Accounting 150 Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 9:15 and follow up that day with Norwigan at 11. I have this class early in the morning at 8:00 and follow that class with bowling at 11:00. I do work a lot as well. I work 10 hours at Marty's and I just was hired at fairway so my schedule will be a bit busier.
